# Statistical Regression Models Applied to the Analysis of the Permanent Household Survey (EPH)

For the course "Statistical Approach to Learning," taught during the second semester of the  “Maestría en Explotación de Datos y Descubrimiento del Conocimiento” (Master’s in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery) program at the Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), we began with the dataset from Argentina’s Permanent Household Survey (EPH). The objective of the analysis is to build models to explain and predict individuals’ hourly wages, employing various statistical analysis techniques.

## Tools Used
- **Language**: R
- **Libraries**: Tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Initial exploration to identify trends and patterns.
3. **Modeling**: Developing regression models to predict the dependent variable `salario_horario`. For each model, the significance of the independent variables is analyzed, and model diagnostics are performed to check the assumptions inherent to simple and multiple linear regression models.
